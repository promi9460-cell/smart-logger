Smart Event Logger is a Python-based desktop application developed using Tkinter to demonstrate event handling, file input/output, and logging. The system records user actions and system errors in a structured log file for debugging and analysis. It also provides real-time log monitoring, a smart dashboard for system health, and basic security using a PIN lock. This project reflects real-world software practices used in monitoring, diagnostics, and system maintenance.
